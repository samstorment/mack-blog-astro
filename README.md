## Project Structure

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                 | Action                                             |
| :---------------------- | :------------------------------------------------- |
| `pnpm install`          | Installs dependencies                              |
| `pnpm run dev`          | Starts local dev server at `localhost:3000`        |
| `pnpm run build`        | Build your production site to `./dist/`            |
| `pnpm run preview`      | Preview your build locally, before deploying       |
| `pnpm run astro ...`    | Run CLI commands like `astro add`, `astro preview` |
| `pnpm run astro --help` | Get help using the Astro CLI                       |
