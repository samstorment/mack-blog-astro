<h2 style="text-align: center;">Centered Heading</h2>

Here is my silly little regular paragraph

<p style="text-align: center;">Here's a centered Paragraph</p>


<div style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 1em; border-radius: .25em;">
  <p>Hey there everyone!!!</div>
</div>

## Heading Number 2

Do you know I adore you
A million ways to show you
I do (uh-uh-uh)
I do (uh-uh-uh)

Every moment holding
You is a moment stolen
It's true (uh-uh-uh)
It's true (uh-uh-uh)

Oh, woah, woah
Gotta be now or never
Oh, woah, woah
Time ain't waiting forever

So let's start waking up dreaming
And dress up crazy like superstars
There ain't no shaking this feeling
Tonight we're making our way to Mars

Way up higher than we've ever been
No we won't stop at the ceiling
So let's keep waking up dreaming

Now is the perfect timing
You know it's worth us finding
The rush (uh-uh-uh)
The rush (uh-uh-uh)

What if there's no tomorrow
I promise I won't let go, no
Matter what (uh-uh-uh)
Matter what (uh-uh-uh)

Oh, woah, woah
Gotta be now or never
Oh, woah, woah
Time ain't waiting forever
